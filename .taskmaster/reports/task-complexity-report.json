			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the CMake build system setup into: (1) root project definition, (2) directory structure and modular CMakeLists, (3) build presets and toolchain support, (4) versioning and configuration, (5) install/export targets, (6) third-party dependency integration (RocksDB), (7) CI integration, and (8) cross-platform validation/documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a modern, cross-platform CMake build system with modular structure, presets, dependency management, install/export targets, and CI integration is a complex, multi-faceted task. It requires careful attention to best practices for maintainability, portability, and downstream consumption, as well as robust testing across platforms and configurations[1][2][3][5]."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Model Primitives",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Value class hierarchy (Integer, Float, String, Boolean, etc.), (2) Schema definition (Column, Table, Document), (3) Result set representation, (4) Serialization/deserialization, (5) Memory management and copy semantics, (6) FFI compatibility design and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Defining robust, extensible data model primitives with serialization, memory safety, and FFI compatibility is moderately complex and foundational. Each aspect (type hierarchy, schema, result sets, serialization, memory, FFI) is a distinct concern requiring careful design and testing."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Relational storage interface definition, (2) Document storage interface definition, (3) In-memory implementation for both, (4) Error handling and validation, (5) Unit tests for all operations and edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "Designing abstract, extensible storage APIs for both relational and document models, plus providing a testable in-memory implementation, involves interface design, error handling, and comprehensive testing. Each API and implementation is a logical subtask."

			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Tokenizer/lexer implementation, (2) Recursive descent parser for SELECT, (3) Parser for INSERT, (4) AST structure and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "A minimal hand-rolled parser for a query language is a focused but non-trivial task, involving lexical analysis, parsing logic for each statement type, AST construction, and robust error handling. Each parser component is a clear subtask."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Query Execution Engine",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Query executor interface and core, (2) SELECT statement execution, (3) INSERT statement execution, (4) Basic query optimization, (5) Integration and end-to-end tests with parser and storage.",
			"reasoning": "Building a query execution engine that bridges parsed statements and storage, with basic optimization and integration testing, is moderately complex. Each execution path and integration point is a logical subtask."

			"reasoning": "Designing a stable, idiomatic C ABI for a C++ core, with proper memory management, opaque types, CRUD bindings, result set access, and comprehensive testing, is complex and error-prone. Each ABI aspect and its testing/documentation is a necessary subtask."

			"reasoning": "Integrating RocksDB via its C API and implementing basic storage operations is moderately complex, especially with configuration and error handling. Each operation and testing is a logical subtask."

			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Minimal query parser for SELECT/INSERT, (2) Query-to-RocksDB mapping logic, (3) Tests for query execution and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "A minimal query layer for mapping simple queries to RocksDB is less complex than a full parser or engine, but still requires parsing, mapping, and testing. Each is a clear subtask."
