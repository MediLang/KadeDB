			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup CMake Build System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the CMake build system setup into: (1) Root CMakeLists.txt creation and project definition, (2) Directory structure and subdirectory CMakeLists.txt files, (3) CMake presets for Debug/Release and cross-platform support, (4) Version numbering and configure_file integration, (5) Install targets and export configuration for find_package, (6) Third-party dependency integration (RocksDB), (7) CI build/test verification scripts.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a modern, modular CMake build system with cross-platform support, dependency management, versioning, install/export targets, and CI integration is a complex, multi-faceted task. It requires knowledge of CMake best practices, toolchains, presets, and integration with external libraries, as well as ensuring downstream usability and maintainability. Each aspect (structure, presets, dependencies, install/export, CI) is a significant subtask in itself and should be handled separately for clarity and maintainability.[1][2][3][5]"

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Model Primitives",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the implementation of data model primitives into: (1) Value class hierarchy (Integer, Float, String, Boolean, etc.), (2) Schema definition classes (Column, Table, Document), (3) Result set representations, (4) Serialization/deserialization logic, (5) Memory management and copy/move semantics, (6) FFI compatibility design and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Defining a robust set of data model primitives with extensible type hierarchies, serialization, and FFI compatibility is moderately complex. Each area—type hierarchy, schema, result sets, serialization, memory management, and FFI—requires careful design and testing to ensure correctness, extensibility, and future C binding support."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Storage API",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the storage API implementation into: (1) Relational storage interface definition, (2) Document storage interface definition, (3) In-memory implementation for both APIs, (4) Extensibility hooks for future backends, (5) Comprehensive unit tests for all operations and error cases.",
			"reasoning": "Designing abstract storage APIs for both relational and document models, plus providing a testable in-memory implementation, involves interface design, extensibility planning, and thorough testing. Each API and its implementation/testing is a distinct subtask, and extensibility is critical for future backend support."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement KadeQL Parser Subset",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the parser implementation into: (1) Tokenizer/lexer for KadeQL, (2) Recursive descent parser for SELECT statements, (3) Parser for INSERT statements, (4) AST construction and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "A minimal hand-rolled parser for a SQL-like language is a focused but non-trivial task. Tokenization, parsing SELECT/INSERT, AST construction, and robust error handling are each distinct and require careful attention to correctness and maintainability."

			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Query Execution Engine",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the query execution engine into: (1) Execution logic for SELECT statements, (2) Execution logic for INSERT statements, (3) Integration with storage API, (4) Basic query optimization for simple predicates, (5) End-to-end integration tests with parser and storage.",
			"reasoning": "Building a query execution engine that bridges parsed statements and storage, with even basic optimization, is moderately complex. Each statement type, storage integration, optimization, and integration testing are substantial subtasks."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create C ABI Interface",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the C ABI interface into: (1) C header design for versioning and initialization, (2) Opaque type and memory management functions, (3) CRUD operation bindings, (4) Result set access and iteration, (5) C++ implementation of ABI glue, (6) C test suite for ABI validation and memory safety.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a stable, idiomatic C ABI for a C++ core is challenging, especially with opaque types, memory management, and cross-language semantics. Each ABI area (headers, memory, CRUD, result sets, C++ glue, testing) is a significant subtask requiring careful design and validation."

			"taskTitle": "Implement KadeDB-Lite RocksDB Backend",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the RocksDB backend implementation into: (1) Initialization/open/close logic, (2) Put/get operations, (3) Configuration options mapping, (4) Error handling and reporting, (5) Unit tests for all operations and configurations.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating RocksDB via its C API and exposing a minimal backend involves several clear subtasks: setup/teardown, CRUD operations, configuration, error handling, and testing. Each is essential for a robust backend."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement KadeDB-Lite Query Layer",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the query layer into: (1) Simple query parser for SELECT/INSERT, (2) Mapping queries to RocksDB operations, (3) Result formatting and return, (4) Query layer tests for valid and invalid queries.",
			"reasoning": "A minimal query layer for basic operations is less complex than a full parser/executor but still requires parsing, mapping, result handling, and testing as distinct subtasks."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Sync Stubs for KadeDB-Lite",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the sync stubs into: (1) Sync configuration struct and parsing, (2) Stub implementations for init/start/stop/status, (3) Tests for stub callability and status reporting.",
			"reasoning": "Stub implementations are simple by design, but configuration, stub functions, and basic tests are still needed for future extensibility and correctness."

			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into: (1) C++ example application using core API, (2) C example using C ABI, (3) KadeDB-Lite CLI sample, (4) CI configuration for multi-platform builds and tests, (5) CI integration of example application builds and test runs.",
			"reasoning": "Developing example applications and robust CI setup involves both application development and DevOps work. Each example and the CI configuration/integration are distinct subtasks, each requiring attention to best practices for usability and maintainability."
