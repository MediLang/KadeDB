# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository, configure build system, and set up CI/CD pipeline for KadeDB and KadeDB-Lite components.
# Details:
1. Create a Git repository with appropriate branching strategy
2. Configure CMake build system for C++17 compatibility
3. Set up separate build configurations for KadeDB server and KadeDB-Lite
4. Configure dependency management for RocksDB, ANTLR, and OpenSSL
5. Implement CI/CD pipeline with unit testing integration
6. Create development environment documentation
7. Setup cross-compilation environment for ARM Cortex-M targets

Example CMakeLists.txt structure:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(KadeDB VERSION 0.1.0 LANGUAGES CXX C)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Options
option(BUILD_KADEDB_SERVER "Build KadeDB Server" ON)
option(BUILD_KADEDB_LITE "Build KadeDB-Lite" ON)

# Dependencies
find_package(RocksDB REQUIRED)
find_package(ANTLR REQUIRED)
find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)

if(BUILD_KADEDB_SERVER)
  add_subdirectory(src/server)
endif()

if(BUILD_KADEDB_LITE)
  add_subdirectory(src/lite)
endif()
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify successful build on all target platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
2. Confirm cross-compilation for ARM Cortex-M4 targets
3. Validate dependency resolution and linking
4. Test CI/CD pipeline with sample commits
5. Verify documentation accuracy with team review

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository and Directory Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the Git repository with appropriate branching strategy and set up the initial directory structure for KadeDB and KadeDB-Lite components.
### Details:
1. Initialize Git repository with main/develop branches
2. Create .gitignore file with appropriate C++ patterns
3. Set up directory structure: src/server for KadeDB, src/lite for KadeDB-Lite, include/ for headers, test/ for unit tests, docs/ for documentation
4. Create initial README.md with project overview
5. Configure Git hooks for code quality checks

## 2. Configure CMake Build System [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the CMake build system with proper configuration for both KadeDB server and KadeDB-Lite components, including dependency management.
### Details:
1. Create root CMakeLists.txt with project definition and C++17 configuration
2. Set up build options for KadeDB server and KadeDB-Lite
3. Configure dependency finding for RocksDB, ANTLR, and OpenSSL
4. Create component-specific CMakeLists.txt in src/server and src/lite
5. Set up include paths and library linking
6. Configure build output directories
7. Add cross-compilation support for ARM Cortex-M targets

## 3. Implement CI/CD Pipeline Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipeline with automated testing, code quality checks, and build verification.
### Details:
1. Create GitHub Actions or GitLab CI configuration file
2. Configure build jobs for different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
3. Set up unit test execution as part of the pipeline
4. Add static code analysis with clang-tidy or similar tool
5. Configure code coverage reporting
6. Set up artifact generation and storage
7. Add deployment steps for releases

## 4. Configure Dependency Management [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Implement a robust dependency management system for third-party libraries including RocksDB, ANTLR, and OpenSSL.
### Details:
1. Create a dependency management script using CMake's FetchContent or ExternalProject
2. Configure version pinning for each dependency
3. Add options for using system-installed dependencies vs. building from source
4. Set up proper include paths and library linking
5. Create FindXXX.cmake modules for custom dependency resolution
6. Document dependency requirements and versions
7. Handle platform-specific dependency configurations

## 5. Create Development Environment Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Prepare comprehensive documentation for setting up the development environment, building the project, and contributing to the codebase.
### Details:
1. Create CONTRIBUTING.md with development workflow guidelines
2. Write detailed build instructions for all supported platforms
3. Document dependency installation requirements
4. Create a developer setup script for common environments
5. Document code style guidelines and enforcement tools
6. Add API documentation structure and generation configuration
7. Include cross-compilation instructions for embedded targets
8. Document testing procedures and requirements
