# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Storage Layer Foundation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core storage layer components including file-based storage with custom format, page management system, buffer pool for caching, and write-ahead logging.
# Details:
1. Design and implement the storage file format:
   - Header structure with metadata
   - Page-based organization
   - Versioning support

2. Implement page management system:
   - Fixed-size page allocation
   - Page types (data, index, overflow)
   - Page header structure
   - Free space management

3. Develop buffer pool for caching:
   - LRU eviction policy
   - Dirty page tracking
   - Thread-safe page access
   - Configurable memory limits

4. Implement write-ahead logging (WAL):
   - Log record format
   - Transaction markers
   - Checkpoint mechanism
   - Recovery procedures

Key classes:
```cpp
class StorageManager {
public:
  Page* allocatePage(PageType type);
  void freePage(PageId id);
  Page* fetchPage(PageId id);
  void flushPage(PageId id);
  void flushAll();
private:
  BufferPool bufferPool_;
  FileManager fileManager_;
  WALManager walManager_;
};

class BufferPool {
public:
  Page* getPage(PageId id);
  void releasePage(PageId id);
  void markDirty(PageId id);
private:
  std::unordered_map<PageId, Frame> frames_;
  LRUList lruList_;
};

class WALManager {
public:
  LogSequenceNumber appendLogRecord(const LogRecord& record);
  void checkpoint();
  void recover();
private:
  File logFile_;
  LogSequenceNumber currentLSN_;
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each component (file manager, page manager, buffer pool, WAL)
2. Integration tests for the complete storage layer
3. Performance benchmarks for read/write operations
4. Stress tests with concurrent access
5. Recovery tests simulating crashes at various points
6. Memory leak detection with valgrind
7. Test with various page sizes and buffer configurations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement File Manager with Custom Format [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the FileManager class that handles low-level file operations, implements the custom storage format with metadata headers, page-based organization, and versioning support.
### Details:
Implement the FileManager class with methods for creating, opening, and closing database files. Define the file header structure with metadata including version, creation timestamp, and page size. Implement methods for reading and writing pages at specific offsets. The file format should support a page directory to track allocated pages and their types. Use memory-mapped files if possible for performance.

## 2. Develop Page Management System [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement the page abstraction with fixed-size allocation, different page types (data, index, overflow), page headers, and free space management.
### Details:
Create Page and PageId classes to represent database pages. Implement page header structure with type, LSN, checksum, and free space tracking. Add methods for serializing/deserializing page content. Implement free space management within pages using slot-based approach or free space pointers. Add utility functions for page splitting and merging. Extend FileManager to track free pages for reallocation.

## 3. Build Buffer Pool with Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement the BufferPool class that provides memory caching of pages with LRU eviction policy, dirty page tracking, and thread-safe access.
### Details:
Create Frame class to represent a page in memory. Implement LRU eviction using a doubly-linked list and hash map for O(1) operations. Add thread synchronization using mutexes or reader-writer locks for concurrent access. Implement dirty page tracking to identify pages that need to be written back to disk. Add configurable memory limits and eviction policies. Implement pin/unpin mechanism to prevent eviction of in-use pages.

## 4. Implement Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create the WALManager class that handles transaction logging with log record formats, transaction markers, and checkpoint mechanisms.
### Details:
Define LogRecord structure with operation type, affected page, before/after images, and transaction ID. Implement WALManager with methods to append log records and assign LSNs. Create checkpoint mechanism to periodically flush dirty pages and record system state. Implement log file management with rotation and archiving. Add methods to iterate through log records for recovery operations.

## 5. Integrate Components and Implement Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Connect all components through the StorageManager class and implement recovery procedures using the WAL.
### Details:
Implement StorageManager as the main interface for storage operations. Connect BufferPool, FileManager, and WALManager. Implement recovery procedures using ARIES algorithm: analysis, redo, and undo phases. Add system startup and shutdown procedures that handle recovery and ensure data consistency. Implement transaction begin/commit/abort operations that coordinate with the WAL. Add configuration options for tuning performance parameters.
