# Overview
Complete multi-model capabilities and introduce robust compliance/security features. Expand distributed architecture and synchronization for real deployments.

# Core Features
- Full multi-model: relational, document, time-series, graph
- Distributed sharding/replication; caching strategies
- Security: AES-256 (core), RBAC, audit logging; Lite AES-128
- Compliance focus: HIPAA/GDPR, data retention and auditing
- Industry connectors: FHIR/HL7, AMQP, OPC UA

# User Experience
- Admin can configure roles, retention, encryption policies
- Operators can deploy services and scale out
- Developers can use connectors to integrate with industry systems

# Technical Architecture
- Distributed components and cluster membership
- Stronger sync protocols and conflict resolution
- Compliance modules for logging, PII handling, and policy enforcement
- Arrow C Data Interface for zero-copy interop where appropriate

# Development Roadmap
- Multi-model query planning improvements
- Distributed features: partitioning, leader election (if needed), failover
- Security/compliance modules: encryption, RBAC, audit trails
- Connector maturity: FHIR/HL7 ingest and mapping; AMQP; OPC UA

# Logical Dependency Chain
1) Solid single-node core + services
2) Add distributed substrate
3) Wrap with compliance and security guarantees

# Risks and Mitigations
- Compliance scope: strict scoping and legal review checkpoints
- Distributed correctness: use property tests and chaos testing

# Appendix
- Threat model and compliance checklist
- Data governance and lifecycle docs
