# Overview
Prepare for open-source release and broader adoption: packaging, SDKs, documentation, CI/CD hardening, and examples across industries.

# Core Features
- Packaging: C++ (Deb/RPM), Rust binaries, Docker images
- SDKs/bindings: Python (pybind11 or PyO3), C headers, sample Rust client
- Docs: developer guide, admin guide, operations/runbooks, tutorials
- CI/CD: coverage, sanitizers, release pipelines, supply-chain security

# User Experience
- Quickstart guides for common deployments
- Example apps (healthcare, finance, manufacturing)
</context>
<PRD>
# Technical Architecture
- Release automation via GitHub Actions
- Versioning and changelog policy
- Doc site publishing (Read the Docs)

# Development Roadmap
- Packaging for major platforms
- SDKs with examples and tests
- Docker Compose examples for local cluster
- Harden CI: SAST/dependency checks, signing

# Logical Dependency Chain
1) Stabilize interfaces and APIs
2) Build SDKs atop stabilized core/services
3) Package and document

# Risks and Mitigations
- Fragmentation: maintain compatibility matrix
- Distribution complexity: start with Linux, add others incrementally

# Appendix
- Release checklist and template
- Example app list and owners
