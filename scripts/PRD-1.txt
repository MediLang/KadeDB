# KadeDB Phase 1: Foundation (2025-2026)

## Overview
Phase 1 establishes the core foundation of KadeDB with a focus on essential multi-model storage capabilities and healthcare applications. This phase prioritizes building a solid architecture that can support future expansion while delivering immediate value for healthcare use cases and IoT data collection.

## Core Features

### 1. Base Storage Engines
- **Relational Storage Engine**
  - ACID-compliant tables for structured healthcare data
  - Basic indexing with B+ tree implementation
  - Support for primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
  - Transaction management with MVCC

- **Document Storage Engine**
  - JSON-like storage for medical notes and configurations
  - Basic document validation
  - Simple path-based queries
  - Initial indexing support

### 2. KadeQL Foundation
- Basic query parser supporting:
  - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE for relational data
  - Document retrieval and manipulation
  - Simple JOIN operations
  - Basic aggregation functions
- Query planner with rule-based optimization
- Result set management

### 3. KadeDB-Lite Prototype
- **RocksDB Integration**
  - Key-value storage foundation
  - Basic compaction strategies
  - Write-ahead logging

- **Time-Series Support**
  - Simple time-based partitioning
  - Basic aggregation (min, max, avg)
  - Retention policies

- **Minimal KadeQL**
  - SELECT and INSERT operations only
  - Local data queries
  - No JOIN support in Phase 1

### 4. Healthcare Integration
- **FHIR Data Model**
  - Patient resource support
  - Observation resource support
  - Basic resource validation
  
- **Security Foundation**
  - AES-256 encryption for KadeDB
  - AES-128 encryption for KadeDB-Lite
  - Basic authentication framework
  - Initial audit logging

## User Experience

### Target Users for Phase 1
1. **Healthcare Application Developers**
   - Building proof-of-concept EHR systems
   - Developing patient data management tools
   - Creating basic telemedicine applications

2. **IoT Engineers**
   - Prototyping medical device data collection
   - Testing edge storage capabilities
   - Evaluating synchronization patterns

### Key User Flows
1. **Basic Healthcare Data Management**
   - Store patient records in relational tables
   - Save clinical notes as documents
   - Query patient data using KadeQL
   - Export data in FHIR format

2. **IoT Data Collection**
   - Collect sensor data on KadeDB-Lite
   - Store time-series measurements locally
   - Basic local querying
   - Manual sync to server (automated sync in Phase 2)

## Technical Architecture

### KadeDB Server Components
- **Storage Layer**
  - File-based storage with custom format
  - Page management system
  - Buffer pool for caching
  - Write-ahead logging

- **Query Engine**
  - ANTLR-based parser for KadeQL
  - Simple query executor
  - Basic result formatting

- **API Layer**
  - REST API for basic operations
  - Simple authentication
  - JSON request/response format

### KadeDB-Lite Components
- **Embedded Storage**
  - RocksDB with custom configuration
  - Minimal memory usage optimization
  - Simple key-value interface

- **Query Interface**
  - Simplified KadeQL parser
  - Local-only query execution
  - Basic result handling

## Development Priorities

### Must-Have Features
1. Working relational and document storage
2. Basic KadeQL implementation
3. KadeDB-Lite with time-series support
4. FHIR patient and observation resources
5. Basic encryption and authentication
6. REST API for server operations

### Nice-to-Have Features
1. Advanced indexing strategies
2. Query optimization beyond basics
3. Automated IoT synchronization
4. Additional FHIR resources
5. Performance monitoring tools

## Dependencies and Prerequisites
- No external phase dependencies (this is the foundation)
- Required technologies:
  - C++17 compiler for KadeDB
  - C compiler for KadeDB-Lite
  - RocksDB library
  - ANTLR for parsing
  - OpenSSL for encryption

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
1. **Storage Engine Complexity**
   - Risk: Building custom storage engines from scratch is complex
   - Mitigation: Start with simple implementations, leverage existing libraries where possible

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Risk: KadeDB-Lite must work on various IoT platforms
   - Mitigation: Focus on ARM Cortex-M as primary target, expand later

### Resource Risks
1. **Limited Features for Early Adoption**
   - Risk: Phase 1 features may be too limited for production use
   - Mitigation: Clear communication about roadmap, focus on proof-of-concept use cases

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully store and retrieve relational and document data
2. KadeDB-Lite runs on ARM Cortex-M4 with <256KB RAM
3. Basic FHIR resources can be stored and queried
4. All data encrypted at rest
5. REST API functional for basic operations
6. Example healthcare application demonstrating capabilities

## Deliverables
1. KadeDB server with relational and document storage
2. KadeDB-Lite embedded database
3. KadeQL parser and basic query engine
4. REST API server
5. Healthcare example applications
6. Basic documentation and setup guides
