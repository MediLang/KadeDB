# KadeDB: A Multi-Model Database for Healthcare and Beyond

## Overview

KadeDB is a versatile multi-model database designed to support a wide range of applications, from healthcare to finance, logistics, manufacturing, smart cities, and scientific research. It unifies:

- **Relational** storage for structured data (e.g., records, inventories)
- **Document** storage for semi-structured data (e.g., logs, configurations)
- **Time-series** storage for temporal data (e.g., sensor readings, market ticks)
- **Graph** storage for network data (e.g., networks, relationships)

Optimized for high-performance computing (HPC) on servers and edge nodes, KadeDB includes a lightweight client, KadeDB-Lite, for resource-constrained IoT and wearable devices.

### Components

- **KadeDB**: Built in C++ for top performance, GPU acceleration, and scalability, ideal for compute-intensive analytics and large-scale data management.
- **KadeDB-Lite**: Built in C for minimal resource usage, targeting IoT devices with a RocksDB-based embedded storage engine and low-bandwidth syncing.
