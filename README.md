# KadeDB: A Multi-Model Database for Medi and Medi-CMM

## Problem Statement

The Medi programming language and its Medi-CMM (Computational Molecular Medicine) extension aim to transform healthcare by providing a domain-specific language (DSL) for medical applications. 

### Medi Focus Areas:
- **General Healthcare**: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telemedicine, clinical decision support, and billing
- **Medi-CMM**: Drug discovery, molecular diagnostics, protein engineering, pharmacogenomics, and biomaterial design

### Data Challenges:
- **Structured Data**: Patient records, PDB files
- **Semi-structured**: Multi-omics data, clinical notes
- **Time-series**: Molecular dynamics trajectories, wearable vitals
- **Graph-like**: Molecular interactions, pharmacogenomic networks

### Technical Requirements:
- High-performance computing (HPC)
- Interoperability with standards (FHIR, HL7) and tools (PyRosetta, AlphaFold)
- Strict regulatory compliance (HIPAA, GDPR)

### Limitations of Existing Databases:

| Database Type | Strengths | Limitations for Medi/Medi-CMM |
|--------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Relational (PostgreSQL) | Structured data, ACID compliance | Poor scalability for large datasets, inefficient for time-series/graph |
| Document Stores (MongoDB) | Handles semi-structured data | Lacks ACID compliance |
| Time-Series (TimescaleDB) | Optimized for high-frequency data | Not suitable for complex relationships |
| Graph (Neo4j) | Excellent for relationship queries | Not designed for transactional/time-series data |

A hybrid database ecosystem is complex to manage. Medi needs a unified, domain-specific solution that supports both general healthcare and computational molecular medicine.

## Solution: KadeDB

KadeDB is a multi-model database designed to unify relational, document, time-series, and graph storage into a single system tailored for Medi and Medi-CMM.

### Key Features

#### Multi-Model Storage:
- **Relational**: ACID-compliant tables for structured data (EHRs, PDB files, billing records)
- **Document**: JSON-like storage for semi-structured data (clinical notes, multi-omics, simulation metadata)
- **Time-Series**: Optimized for high-frequency data (wearable vitals, molecular dynamics trajectories)
- **Graph**: Nodes and edges for molecular interactions, pharmacogenomic networks, and clinical relationships

#### Core Capabilities:
- **KadeQL**: Unified query language supporting SQL-like, Cypher-like, and time-series queries
- **HPC Optimization**: In-memory caching, GPU-accelerated processing, parallel query execution
- **Interoperability**: Native connectors for FHIR, HL7, DICOM, and computational tools
- **Compliance**: Built-in encryption, role-based access control, audit logging (HIPAA/GDPR)
- **Reproducibility**: Version control for datasets, models, and simulation parameters
- **Scalability**: Distributed architecture for large-scale datasets

## Technical Architecture

### Data Model

KadeDB's multi-model architecture supports:

1. **Relational Tables**
   - Structured data with strict schemas
   - ACID guarantees
   - Examples: Patient records, billing, PDB files

2. **Document Store**
   - JSON-like documents
   - Flexible schema for semi-structured data
   - Examples: Clinical notes, multi-omics datasets

3. **Time-Series Engine**
   - Optimized indexing
   - High-frequency data handling
   - Examples: Wearable vitals, simulation trajectories

4. **Graph Layer**
   - Nodes and edges representation
   - Relationship-focused queries
   - Examples: Molecular interactions, clinical relationships

### KadeQL: Query Language

```sql
-- Example query combining multiple data models
FROM KadeDB
SELECT patient, molecule, binding_energy, vitals
WHERE patient.id = "P001"
  AND molecule.pdb_id = "4HDB"
  AND binding_energy < -8.5
  AND vitals.time_range("2025-06-01", "2025-06-03")
  LINKED_TO binding_site(radius=12.0);
```

### Storage Engine

- **Hybrid Storage**: Combines row-based, columnar, and graph storage
- **In-Memory Caching**: For real-time queries
- **GPU Acceleration**: For compute-intensive workloads
- **Distributed Architecture**: Horizontal scaling capabilities

## Use Cases

### 1. Electronic Health Records (Medi)

**Data**: Patient records, billing, clinical histories  
**Role**: Relational + document + time-series storage

```javascript
let patient = Patient.from_fhir("patient.json");
patient.save_to_kadedb("ehr", "patient_records");
```

```sql
FROM KadeDB.ehr
SELECT patient
WHERE diagnosis = "diabetes"
  AND vitals.heart_rate > 100;
```

### 2. Computational Drug Discovery (Medi-CMM)

**Data**: PDB files, chemical libraries, screening results  
**Role**: Relational + document + graph storage

```javascript
let target = Protein.from_pdb("4HDB");
let screening = VirtualScreening.new()
    .with_compounds(ChemicalLibrary.from_smiles("compounds.smi"));
let hits = screening.execute(parallel_jobs=64);
hits.save_to_kadedb("drug_discovery", "hits");
```

### 3. Molecular Diagnostics (Medi-CMM)

**Data**: Multi-omics datasets, diagnostic models  
**Role**: Document + graph storage

```javascript
let patient_data = MultiOmicsData.from_files({
    "transcriptomics": "rna_seq.csv"
});
let model = DiagnosticModel.new().train(data: patient_data);
model.save_to_kadedb("diagnostics", "validated_model");
```
